## About the Course

The Python Programming MOOC 2026 is a free online course from the **Department of Computer Science at the University of Helsinki**. It is divided into two tracks:

| Track | Parts |
|---|---|
| Introduction to Programming (BSCS1001) | Parts 1 – 7 |
| Advanced Course in Programming (BSCS1002) | Parts 8 – 14 |

The course runs throughout the year 2026 and covers Python from the very basics up to advanced programming concepts.

Note: Some of the exercise text may be in my native language, Brazilian Portuguese.
